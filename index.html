      Wydad Athletic Club (Arabic: نادي الوداد الرياضي, Arabic pronunciation:
      [naːdiː‿l.widaːd arrːiyːadˤiː]), commonly shortened to just Wydad AC or
      Wydad, is a Moroccan sports club based in Casablanca. Wydad AC is best
      known for its professional football team that competes in Botola, the top
      tier of the Moroccan football league system. They are one of three clubs
      to have never been relegated from the top flight. It was founded on 8 May
      1937 by seven Moroccans belonging to the national movement for
      independence, led by Mohamed Benjelloun Touimi. They initially focused on
      water polo to give indigenous Moroccans the right to access swimming pools
      before Mohamed Ben Lahcen Affani – also known by the nickname of "Père
      Jégo" ("Father Jégo") – created the football section in 1939. He was the
      first manager of the team. The club has traditionally worn a red home kit
      since inception.

      Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə]
      ⓘ), commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]),
      is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that
      competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899
      by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan
      Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism,
      hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club").[2] Unlike many
      other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the
      third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and
      the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an
      annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is
      the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5]
      Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes,
      hence nicknamed Blaugrana.
